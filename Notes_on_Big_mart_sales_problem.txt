1. Objective:
	The Big Mart firm has 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. The goal is to predict the sales
	of each product at a particular store
	
2. Data Exploration:
	2.1 Univariate analysis	
		2.1.1 For Continuous variables
			1. Item_Weight
				The average weight of the products stands around 13.5 (assuming the unit:kg)
				The lowest weight: between 4-5 kg
				The Maximum weight: 20-23 kg
				Distribution: Almost Normal
				No outliers in whisker
			2. Item_Visibility
				On an average the products are visible with 0.07% of total area in that store
				The minimum: Some where around 0% - May be for small product
				The maximum: Cannot conclude as there are many outliers.
				Distribution: +vely skewed: Majority of items have visibility lower than the average
			3. Item_MRP
				Average MRP: 140-150 dollars
				Maximum: 250-270
				Minimum: 30-50
				Distribution:Almost Normal
				No outliers
			4. Item_Outlet_Sales
				Average sales: Some where around 2000 dollars
				Outliers: Too many
				Distribution: +vely skewed: Majority of items in a store have sales lower than the average.
					
		2.1.2 For Categorical variables
			1. Item-Identifier: There are 1559 unique products
			2. Item_Type:
				Snack food, Fruit and vegetables is the most available product in the mart with 14% each
				Frozen foods and Household with 10% availability each
				Baking Goods, Canned, dairy with 7-8% availability each
				Followed by Health&Hygiene(6),Soft drinks(5), Meat(5),Breads(3),Hard Drinks(2)
				Starchy food(2), others(2), Breakfast(1), seafood(1) are least available
			3. Outlet_Identifier: There are 10 outlets in total.
			4. Outlet_Type
				There are 4 outlets in total: Grocery store, supermarket 1, supermarket 2, supermarket 3.
				Out of 10 outlets, 6 are of supermarket type 1
				2 Outlets are grocery stores
				Remaining 2 outlets are supermarket type 2 and 3 respectively
			5. Outlet_Est_Year
				2 outlets were established in 1985 - Grocery store and SM type 3
				10 years later SMT-1 was started
				In 1998, second Grocery store was started
				SMT-2 was only established in 2009(the recent one)
			6. Item_Fat_Content
				Out of 1559 items, 1008 items are low fat items, 551 items are regular items
			7. Outlet_size
				In 10 outlets, 3 medium sized outlets, 3 small sized outlets, 1 high sized outlets
				Size of 3 outlets are unknown. They are Outlet no 10, 45 and 17
			8. Outlet_Location_Type
				3 outlets are in tier - 1
				3 outlets are in tier - 2
				4 outlets are in tier - 3
				
	2.2 Bivariate analysis
		2.2.1 Continuous-Continuous
			1. Item_Weight - Item_Visibility: No significant relationship
			2. Item_Weight - Item_MRP: It is significant, slightly +vely correlated
			3. Item_Weight - Item_Outlet_Sales: No significant relationship
			4. Item_Visibility - Item_MRP: No significant relationship
			5. Item_Visibility - Item_Outlet_Sales: Significant relationship, negatively correlated, weak downhill correlation
			6. Item_MRP - Item_Outlet_Sales: Significant relationship, positively correlated, moderate uphill correlation
				Key take aways:
					As the item's size increase more than 0.20, then the outlet sales fall dramatically
					As the item's MRP increases the outlet sales increase moderately till the MRP becomes ~= 170. After that it smoothen. 
					Item_Weight is irrelevant to Items_Outlet_Sales(Target variable)

3. Data Preparation
	1. There are around 526 observations which have Item_Visibility=0. Since it is not possible, I am turning them into missing values. 
	2. Imputing missing values
		1. Item_Weight - 4 missing values are there. Imputing them with mean
		2. Outlet_Size - 2410 missing values
			1. Outliers treatment
				We have 2 outliers Item_Outlet_Sales and Item_Visibility
					1. Item_Visibility
						Took cube root, removed remaining 3 outliers as missing values
						Now Item_Visibility has 529 missing values
					2. Item_Outlet_Sales
						Took cube root, removed remaining 3 outliers and imputed with mean. 
						
			2. Bivariate Analysis
				To look for how the above data transformation affects Outlet_size
				Categorical - Categorical
					No cat variable has a significant relationship with outlet_size
				Continuous-Categorical
					Since only two cat variables were changed, only the cat-cont relationship of those 2 variables will be reviewed
						1. Item_Visibility vs Outlet_size (dependent)
						2. Item_Outlet_Sales vs Outlet_size(dependent)
					
			3. Missing Value imputation 
				The missing values in outlet Size cannot be imputed by mean of Item_Outlet_Sales. Because, the Outlets with one size does not have similar outlet
					size of its outlet size's group mean.
				
		1. Outlet Size: 2410 missing values, missing for Outlet10, 45, 17
			vs Item_Outlet_Sales:
				High:12.49	Medium:13.13, Small:11.33| O10:6.55, O45:12.35, O17:12.62
				
			vs Item_Visibility:
				High:0.3788 Medium:0.3796 Small:0.3981| O10:0.4507 O45:0.3795 O17:0.3822
				
			Item_Outlet_Sales is more significantly related than Item_Visibility(which also has missing values). We will go by Item_Outlet_Sales.
			
			Imputing: O10: Small
					  O17: High
					  O45: High
					  
		2. Item_Weight: Imputed with mean.
					  
		2. Item_Visibility: 529 missing values (6.29% of total no of observations). It is a continuous variable.
			Imputation by Linear Regression
				1. Partitioned the dataset into train(0.70), validation(0.30), test
				2. Checking for Linear Regression Assumptions in train dataset
					1. Multi collinearity
						(Item_Visibility, Item_Outlet_Sales( -0.13)) and (Item_MRP, Item_Outlet_Sales(0.5))
						THERE SEEMS TO BE LOT OF OUTLIERS IN TRAIN SET. SO WE WILL AGAIN EXPLORE THE DATA FOR TRAIN SET ALONE
					
					DATA EXPLORATION FOR TRAIN SET
						Item_Visibility and Item_Outlet_Sales in train dataset has lot of outliers
