1. Objective:
	The Big Mart firm has 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. The goal is to predict the sales
	of each product at a particular store
	
2. Data Exploration:
	2.1 Univariate analysis	
		2.1.1 For Continuous variables
			1. Item_Weight
				The average weight of the products stands around 13.5 (assuming the unit:kg)
				The lowest weight: between 4-5 kg
				The Maximum weight: 20-23 kg
				Distribution: Almost Normal
				No outliers in whisker
			2. Item_Visibility
				On an average the products are visible with 0.07% of total area in that store
				The minimum: Some where around 0% - May be for small product
				The maximum: Cannot conclude as there are many outliers.
				Distribution: +vely skewed: Majority of items have visibility lower than the average
			3. Item_MRP
				Average MRP: 140-150 dollars
				Maximum: 250-270
				Minimum: 30-50
				Distribution:Almost Normal
				No outliers
			4. Item_Outlet_Sales
				Average sales: Some where around 2000 dollars
				Outliers: Too many
				Distribution: +vely skewed: Majority of items in a store have sales lower than the average.
					
		2.1.2 For Categorical variables
			1. Item-Identifier: There are 1559 unique products
			2. Item_Type:
				Snack food, Fruit and vegetables is the most available product in the mart with 14% each
				Frozen foods and Household with 10% availability each
				Baking Goods, Canned, dairy with 7-8% availability each
				Followed by Health&Hygiene(6),Soft drinks(5), Meat(5),Breads(3),Hard Drinks(2)
				Starchy food(2), others(2), Breakfast(1), seafood(1) are least available
			3. Outlet_Identifier: There are 10 outlets in total.
			4. Outlet_Type
				There are 4 outlets in total: Grocery store, supermarket 1, supermarket 2, supermarket 3.
				Out of 10 outlets, 6 are of supermarket type 1
				2 Outlets are grocery stores
				Remaining 2 outlets are supermarket type 2 and 3 respectively
			5. Outlet_Est_Year
				2 outlets were established in 1985 - Grocery store and SM type 3
				10 years later SMT-1 was started
				In 1998, second Grocery store was started
				SMT-2 was only established in 2009(the recent one)
			6. Item_Fat_Content
				Out of 1559 items, 1008 items are low fat items, 551 items are regular items
			7. Outlet_size
				In 10 outlets, 3 medium sized outlets, 3 small sized outlets, 1 high sized outlets
				Size of 3 outlets are unknown. They are Outlet no 10, 45 and 17
			8. Outlet_Location_Type
				3 outlets are in tier - 1
				3 outlets are in tier - 2
				4 outlets are in tier - 3
				
	2.2 Bivariate analysis
		2.2.1 Continuous-Continuous
			1. Item_Weight - Item_Visibility: No significant relationship
			2. Item_Weight - Item_MRP: It is significant, slightly +vely correlated
			3. Item_Weight - Item_Outlet_Sales: No significant relationship
			4. Item_Visibility - Item_MRP: No significant relationship
			5. Item_Visibility - Item_Outlet_Sales: Significant relationship, negatively correlated, weak downhill correlation
			6. Item_MRP - Item_Outlet_Sales: Significant relationship, positively correlated, moderate uphill correlation
				Key take aways:
					As the item's size increase more than 0.20, then the outlet sales fall dramatically
					As the item's MRP increases the outlet sales increase moderately till the MRP becomes ~= 170. After that it smoothen. 
					Item_Weight is irrelevant to Items_Outlet_Sales(Target variable)

3. Data Preparation
	1. There are around 526 observations which have Item_Visibility=0. Since it is not possible, I am turning them into missing values. 
	2. Imputing missing values
		1. Item_Weight - 4 missing values are there. Imputing them with mean
		2. Outlet_Size - 2410 missing values
			1. Outliers treatment
				We have 2 outliers Item_Outlet_Sales and Item_Visibility
					1. Item_Visibility
						Took cube root, removed remaining 3 outliers as missing values
						Now Item_Visibility has 529 missing values
					2. Item_Outlet_Sales
						Took cube root, removed remaining 3 outliers and imputed with mean. 
						
			2. Bivariate Analysis
				To look for how the above data transformation affects Outlet_size
				Categorical - Categorical
					No cat variable has a significant relationship with outlet_size
				Continuous-Categorical
					Since only two cat variables were changed, only the cat-cont relationship of those 2 variables will be reviewed
						1. Item_Visibility vs Outlet_size dependent (Item_Visibility has 526 missing values. This variable will be removed. No use in seeing the relationship.
						2. Item_Outlet_Sales vs Outlet_size(dependent)
					
			3. Missing Value imputation 
				The missing values in outlet Size cannot be imputed by mean of Item_Outlet_Sales. Because, the Outlets with one size does not have similar outlet
					size of its outlet size's group mean.
				KNN Imputation
					1. Item_Visibility is removed as it has 526 missing values. Item-Identifier also removed(unique variables)
					2. Converted all factor variables into numeric variables - For KNN either it should be fully numeric, or fully categorical
					3. Dataset divided into three parts (train, test, validation)
						1. First divided into missing part and non missing part(test set)
						2. The non missing part is further sampled into training set(70% of non missing part) and validation set(30%)
					4. The class labels of train set and validation set are extracted and then the target variable is removed in both the sets
					5. All the three datasets(train, validation, test) all have numeric variables in them. They are normalized.
					6. The train dataset is trained with KNN model and tested in validation with k=26. The accuracy is 0.9983%
					7. The same train set with same k is used in test dataset. The missing values are imputed.
					
		3. Item_Visibility - 526 missing values
			1. Outliers Treatment
				Again we have the same 2 outliers - Item_Visibility and Item_Outlet_Sales
					1. Item_Visibility
						Took cube root, removed remaining 3 outliers as missing values
						Now Item_Visibility has 529 missing values. This will be predicted now.
					2. Item_Outlet_Sales
						Took cube root, removed remaining 3 outliers and imputed with mean. 
						
			2. Bivariate Analysis
				To look how data transformation of Item_Visibility and Item_Outlet_Sales affects Item_Visibility(the target variable)
				Continuous-Continuous
					Item_Visibility - Item_Outlet_Sales
						They have a very significant relationship. Negatively correlated with correlation coefficient: -0.1552268.
				Categorical-Categorical
					No changes
				Continuous-Categorical
					No changes in relationship. The Item_Visibility is dependent with all categorical variables.
					
			3. KNN Imputation
				Linear regression was tried. But the despite all possible basic transformations(except box cox) the residuals did not turn out to be normal. 
				Therefore I am going to try KNN
					1. Transformed all variables into numerical
					2. Normalized all the variables
					3. Data split into train, validation and split.
					3. Train dataset is trained using KNN and then cross validated with repeat 3 times
					4. The RMSE over train set 0.1894 with best k(neighbors)=9
					5. The RMSE over validation set 0.1892 with k=9. The RMSE over train set is very close to RMSe over test set. Hence, the model is not 
						over fitted or biased
					6. Applied the same model to test set. 
					7. Cubed the predicted values to neutralize the initial cubic transformation. 
					8. Copied the variable values to the main set.
					
	3. Final preparation for modeling (without missing values)
		1. Data Exploration
			1. Univariate analysis
				1. Continuous variables
					Item_Visibility and Item_Outlet_Sales - Have too many data points above the whisker. Cannot reject them as outliers. 
					Item_Weight and Item_MRP - Multi modal
					Item_Weight and Item_Outlet_Sales are positively skewed. (unimodal)
					
				2. Cat Variables - No changes
			
			2. Bivariate analysis	
				1. Continuous-Continuous
					There is a correlation - Item_Outlet_Sales, Item_Visibility
					There is a correlation  - Item_MRP, Item_Outlet_Sales
					
				2. Categorical-Categorical
					1. The outlet Size had missing values which were imputed. Now relationship of outlet size with other variables will be explored.
						Outlet_Size vs Item_Type(independent)
						Outlet_Size vs Outlet_Type(independent)
						Outlet_Size vs Item_Fat_Content(independent)
						
					2. To check for the one dependent relation that existed
						Item_Type vs Item_Fat_Content(It stays the same)
					
				3. Continuous-Categorical
						To check for Item_Visibility vs all (dependent with all cat variables)
									Item_Outlet_Sales vs all (dep with Out_Est_year, Outlet_Size)
									Outlet_Size vs Item_Weight and Item_MRP (only on Out_Est_year, Item_Visibility)
			
			3. Outliers Treatment
				Transforming Item_Visibility and Item_Outlet_Sales as they are outliers
				
		2. Model Evaluation
			1. This is a regression problem - List of models that can be used are
				1. Linear
					1. Linear regression (lm)
					2. Generalized Linear Reg (glm)
					3. Penalized Linear reg (glmnet)
				
				2. Non linear
					1. Decision Trees (cart)
					2. KNN (knn)
					3. SVM (with linear basis) (svm)
					
				3. Ensembling Technique
					1. Random forest with bagging (rf)
					2. Gradient Boosting Machines (gbm)
					3. Cubist, Boosting (cubist)
